# Fifa-Tournament

# Problem
In our office we are having a FIFA tournament. Unfortunately, it is difficult to keep track of the scores of each game as the participants are getting more and more. It is almost impossible to build a standing table after every game.

# Solution
My idea is to create an PWA, which keeps track of FIFA games and generates standing table base on the game results between the players. The table will keep track of many statistics like points, scored, received goals, goal difference, played games, win/lost games. Users will receive notification about changes in the standing.
